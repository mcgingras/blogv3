title: 'Design Systems in CSS: They are Hard!'

After spending a few weeks writing lots of CSS for Vitamin Yee, I am realizing just how hard it is to write maintainable CSS. To often, I know what a component should look like, so I create a class, and  style the component exactly as it should look, with everything in one single class. As the project continues to grow, I keep creating more and more one off classes, often with styles that are extremely similar to past classes. 

How to make better classes? How to write CSS that "feels" good. How do you learn these things? It seems to require a lot of up front time to think about what the entire project is going to look like and how it should be architected. Then there is the whole divide between HTML that is functionally relevant, and HTML that is stylistically relevant... there seem to be few best practices in web development, and I am going to try to document some here.

tbd.
