title: The Danger of Abstraction

Today in history: yet another JS framework is released.

<https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood>

Prisma! Graphql! React! Yada Yada! Buzzwords! We are building frameworks on top of frameworks. Every time a new one is released, I suffer a bit from what I like to call abstraction creep.

Abstraction creep is the sense that all of these frameworks are so highly opinionated and providing such strong layers of abstraction over the actual details, that by learning just these frameworks we as developers are learning "how to use redwood" as opposed to how to actually do software engineering. Abstraction is all fine and dandy when your project is within the scope of what the abstraction layer was designed to encompass, but the danger, and what causes the abstraction creep so strongly in me, is when a project's requirements fall outside of the abstraction layer. What then is a developer expected to do? Having spent so much time learning specifics defined by this highly opinionated framework, it can be hard to jump outside of the bubble and actually understand what needs to be done. Herein lies the danger of abstraction -- it shields us from a complete understanding in favor of simplicity.

This is not to say abstraction in \_bad\_ per say, but I think its worth considering.
