Some thoughts...

When thinking about creative tools (tools that allow a user to create... photoshop, mspaint etc.) the user is often presented with a completely blank canvas. Most often, I think of a user interacting with such as canvas as an additive practice; the user adds colors, or strokes, and generally adds more and more content to the screen as they begin to develop an artifact. 

However, I am interested in thinking about how the creative process much be thought of as a reductive practice. We ca think of representing a creative possibility space as an n dimensional matrix where each dimension represents some piece of the possibility space. Drawing in the space reduces the possibilities, since by adding to the canvas you are removing other possibilities in the space that do not include what you have just added. As you continue to add more and more, your canvas approaches a more specific subset of the generalized "blank" set encompassing all future possibility spaces. 

The easiest way I have thought to conceptualize this is with a small example. Imagine we have a 3x3 grid, and users are able to fill each cube of the grid with a color. At the start, all 9 cubes are uncolored, and so the generalized all encompassing set contains all future possible states. If we then color the top square red, we can image that we are 'reducing' the possibility space down to only include states of the 3x3 grid that also have the top square as red. As we color more and more of the cubes, our possibility space reduces down into a more specific form.

To be quite honest, I haven't quite figured out what sort of implications this type of thinking may have, but it's amused me for a while, and this sort of paradigm shift in thinking may come in handy when thinking of states a user may hit in casual creators.
