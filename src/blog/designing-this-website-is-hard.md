title: Websites as Identity
subtitle: What do our websites have to say about ourselves?
---
I'm on my 14th iteration of this website. It is my portfolio -- the public facing version of my internet self. Over the years I've plucked away, spending hours tweaking it's design, only to scrape it all weeks later for something completely new. Why is it so difficult for me to land on something I like? As a web designer/developer, I believe it has much to do with our websites serving as some sort of identity within us. We use these as reflections of ourselves in order to present our style, our interests, our work. When someone visits our website it's as if they are stepping into our digital home. Naturally, it's important to leave a good impression.

In his love letter to personal websites (<https://www.vanschneider.com/a-love-letter-to-personal-websites>) Designer Tobias Van Schneider describes how in a world dominated by social media platforms that restrict the creative control we have over our posts, the personal website is the last frontier in total creative freedom. In his words,

> "At the risk of sounding religious about this, and maybe I am, our personal websites are our temples. They remain the one space on the internet where we decide how we are introduced to friends, potential employees and strangers. Itâ€™s a place where we can express, on our terms, who we are and what we offer."

In this sense, our websites are the truest form of what we can hope to represent to the world as our digital selves. In that monumental context, it makes sense as to why I've spent so long writing and rewriting my personal website. I don't think I will ever be done.
