title: Websites as Identity
subtitle: What do our websites have to say about ourselves?
---
I'm on my 14th iteration of this website. It is my portfolio -- the public facing version of my internet self? Over the years I'll pluck away changing it's design, only to scrape it all weeks later for something new. Why is this process so hard for me? As a web designer/developer, I believe it has much to do with websites serving as some sort of identity within us. We use these as reflections of ourselves -- our style, our interests... when someone visits our website they are stepping into our digital home. Naturally, it's important to leave a good impression.

These thoughts are half baked right now, I want to dig into this deeper. Why is it that we are so attached to our websites, and our digital persona at all? There are times when I want to just make a black and white 'no-css' websites to reject the notion that I need something fancy... but something pulls me away from that.... keep exploring.
