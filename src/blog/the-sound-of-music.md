On occasion, music transcends sound. It grows bigger than simply existing as it does when we enjoy it on subway or as background music to our work. Sometimes, music can spark something within us. It's the feeling when chills run down your spine during a particular nice chord, or the way a certain song evokes memories of love, or loss.

I've had this vague idea that music is more for quite some time now, but it didn't quite click for me until I stumbled into a beautiful comment on a hackernews post. It read,

"These days I'm interested in resonance. It creates excitation and movement across multiple dimensions. It starts in one place in time, and ends up spilling across the rest of your lives and that of others. Maybe you were at a concert, or a church service, or around a campfire when some music struck your 'heart strings'. Something about that sound energy turned your mesh of physiology in a new direction. Maybe you were driving home when you realized something about yourself, and eventually your career took a new path; maybe your love for someone became clear. Whatever happened next, the places you traveled, the things you purchased, the fields you trod upon; all real-world effects started when part of you resonated with some sound energy."

To me, this quote stands to serve as a reminder that the small things in our lives are just as important as the large. Music matters.
