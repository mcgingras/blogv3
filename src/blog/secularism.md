  How is the lack of religiosity in our generation contributing to the depression epedemic? How might we change this?

I read a tweet today about a Priest who decided to step away from the church. His statements for leaving were totally valid, and I actually share many of his beliefs renouncing theology, but the responses he got worried me a bit when thinking about the state of 'religiosity' in America. It's not really a surprise at this point to hear church attendance is at an all time low. But depression, anxiety etc. are at an all time high. Why is this the case? While traditional religion is falling by the wayside, it's more important than ever for us as a community to at least embrace the dogma of religion, if not the story.

I believe that regardless of an individuals beliefs, they have within them an innate desire for *something* spiritual. Something sublime, that touches upon the transcendence of human experience. At the end of the day, isn't that all we are? Humans? To stop and appreciate that fact alone can be called religious.

I don't believe many people realize it, but the ideals of religion are good for us. You don't have to believe in a higher deity to appreciate a soothing of your very real, tangible soul. For that reason, I am interested in products that are working to bring spirituality to the masses. Where is the bridge between technology and spirit? What sort of mystical experiences might be able to create now that nearly every single person is connected by the fingertips? I think there is great potential. But above all else, I believe we as a generation need to stop so eagerly denouncing religion. These statements often come with a hint of condescension *why would I ever believe in a God? Thats so silly...* but the truth really is that a bit of openmindedness to your secularism can go a long way.
